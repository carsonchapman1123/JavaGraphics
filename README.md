# JavaGraphics
This repo gives two examples of programs to generate images using the JFrame library in Java.

### CompleteGraph

CompleteGraph draws a complete graph with an arbitrary number of vertices, which can be edited using the vertices variable. This program can be compiled and executed by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/carsonchapman1123/JavaGraphics
cd JavaGraphics
javac CompleteGraph.java
java CompleteGraph
```


### GeometricStar

GeometricStar draws a four pointed star based on a design I created with a ruler when I was ten years old. I wanted to draw it with more points back then, but it took a long time to draw. I remembered the shape when I was playing with graphics in Java. This program can be compiled and executed by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/carsonchapman1123/JavaGraphics
cd JavaGraphics
javac GeometricStar.java
java GeometricStar
```
