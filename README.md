# JavaGraphics

These two programs are side projects I created out of boredom. CompleteGraph draws a complete graph with an arbitrary number of vertices. GeometricStar draws a four pointed star based on a design I played around with in 4th grade when I was first given a ruler and can draw it with an arbitrary amount of nodes.
